**[Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://chbe.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}, IL USA**  
_Graduate Thesis Student_, [Rao Research Group](https://raogroupuiuc.github.io/webpage/){:target="_blank"} (2016 - 2022)
  - Performed experiments and analyzed multiple RNA sequencing datasets to identify genes and metabolic pathways of interest in various model and non-model organisms. 
  - Collaborated on 10+ projects for bioinformatics analysis, developing pipelines to analyze multi-omics data, such as genome assembly, variant calling, and copy number identification. 
  - Identified new sugar transporters from non-model organisms using bioinformatics analysis
  - Integration of RNA sequencing data with other bioinformatics datasets of various yeast and bacteria for characterizing differences in cellular behavior
  - Studying the mechanism and regulation of storage metabolism in yeasts using computational models. Built a model for storage metabolism in python, with validation using growth experiments
  - Understanding protein-protein interactions: expressed and purified multiple proteins from yeasts.
