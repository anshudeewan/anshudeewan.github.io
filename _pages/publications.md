Published in _Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology_ (2021). [[PDF](../files/2021_paper05.pdf){:target="_blank"}] [[Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11549-8){:target="_blank"}] [[Media](https://twitter.com/CABBIbio/status/1442525310394585089/photo/1){:target="_blank"}]<br>
    * I analysed the transcriptomics and metabolomics data, identified and annotated genes in the non-model yeast _Rhodospridium toruloides_, designed the figures and supplementary material, and contributed to the manuscript writing.  <br>
