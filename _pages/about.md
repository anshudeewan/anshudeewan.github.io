## About me 

I am a chemical engineer by training with 5+ years of research experience in Computational Genomics using Next Generation Sequencing & bioinformatics. My Ph.D. work has been focused on generating insights about cellular behavior using various genomics and bioinformatics data analyses.

My Ph.D. advisor is [Prof. Christopher V. Rao](https://chbe.illinois.edu/directory/profile/cvrao) ([Rao Research Group](https://raogroupuiuc.github.io/webpage/)), and my research work is funded by the following grants by U.S. [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science): Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation ([CABBI](https://cabbi.bio/)) and Genome Scale Engineering Center ([GSE](https://www.igb.illinois.edu/research-areas/gsecenter)).

I have previously been a part of [Unilever Future Leaders Programme](https://careers.unilever.com/unilever-future-leaders-programme) and worked as a Product Manager with [Unilever Research](https://www.hul.co.in/our-company/rd-innovation/our-rd-locations/mumbai-india/). I am skilled in interdisciplinary research & project management in both academic and industry settings.
