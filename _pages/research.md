RNA sequencing analysis
------
Metabolic engineering in yeasts has traditionally been focused on model organisms such as baker's yeast. Our work focuses on studying non-model organisms that offer unique advantages for producing valuable compounds. I have used RNA sequencing analysis as a tool to explore the metabolism of various oil-producing yeasts like _Rhodosporidium toruloides_, _Lipomyces starkeyi_, and methane-consuming bacteria like _Methylococcus capsulatus_. These analyses have led us to identify new opportunities for genetic engineering of these microbes.    

Genome sequencing and mutation analysis
------
Our lab uses metabolic engineering techniques such as directed evolution and integration of DNA fragments to improve the growth characteristics of microbes. In this work, I have designed data analysis pipelines to utilize DNA sequencing for the identification of copy number variations, DNA integration sites, point mutations, and other structural variations in the yeast _Yarrowia lipolytica_.    

Sequence alignment and phylogeny   
------
Simultaneous co-fermentation of glucose and xylose, the two most abundant sugars in cellulosic biomass, is a key trait for efficient production of biofuels and chemicals. In this study, we use bioinformatics analysis to identify two structurally distant transporters, which can facilitate partial and complete co-transportation of glucose and xylose. This work  contributes to the understanding of the sugar co-transport mechanism in yeast and plant, and enables rapid and efficient co-utilization of cellulosic sugars.
